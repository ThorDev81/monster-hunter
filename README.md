# Monster Slayer
 Vuejs course project

 Simple game where player can either attack, special attack, heal or give up. Each action the player does the monster gets a counter. Whoever gets the other to 0 health wins.

 Heals have a 2 turn cooldown.
 Special Attacks have a 3 turn cooldown.

 The monster has the ability to do more damage than the player so the player will have to rely on using their special abilities when able.
